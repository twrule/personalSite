						Hi! My name is Tyler Rule and I am a recent graduate
						from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Through 
						hard work and dedication I was able to graduate early in
						March 2020 and recieved a Bachelors of Science Degree 
						majoring in Computer Science.  While at school I was also
						part of the NCAA Cross Country and NCAA Track and Field 
						teams and in my free time I enjoyed surfing, skating, 
						and rockclimbing in the beautiful Santa Cruz county.  
						Now that school is over I am currently living in Huntington
						Beach, California working on various personal projects
						as well as Lifegaurding at both Bolsa Chica State Beach
						and Huntington State Beach.  Feel free to check everything
						out and contact me with any questions you may have
					</p>

					<td><img src="img/runningMan.gif" alt="running man gif" class="tablePhotos"></td>
					<td>This is a gif of my favorire project for my Computer Graphics course, CSE160, at UCSC.  This animation is live hosted <a href="runningMan/drive.html" target="_blank" class="liveHost">here</a>.  If you navigate to the site you can actually rotate the guy and control him with your mouse.  To code this graphic I used  <span class="importantWord">Javascript</span>, <span class="importantWord">WebGL</span>,  <span class="importantWord">HTML</span>, and <span class="importantWord">CSS</span>.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="img/stockProj.png" alt="Stock Project" class="stocksProjPhoto"></td>
					<td>For my Artificial Intellegence course, CSE140, I built a stock market price predictor.  This tool used Machine Learning and LSTM units to help learn.  When run, the application asks for a stock and generates a csv file with the entirety of that stocks price history.  It then trains on all the generated data to predict the stock's closing market price for the following day using indicators based on the Swing Trading model.  There is a bit of user customizability such as range of dates to train on, any stock that exists can be used, and the model can predict the next day, week, or month's closing price (next day is the most optimal).  The model was adjusted to slightly underpredicts the price to make sure the user would never wait for a stock to hit price that shouldn't happen.  <a href="https://youtu.be/olQMiNtf1M8" target="_blank" class="liveHost">Here</a> is a 5 minute presentation on youtube that we did.  To build this project we used <span class="importantWord">Python</span>, the Alpha Vantage API, <span class="importantWord">LSTM model</span>, <span class="importantWord">Keras</span>, <span class="importantWord">Plotly and Matlib</span>, and <span class="importantWord">RNN architectures</span>.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="img/runnersMatch.png" alt="RunnersMatch" class="stocksProjPhoto"></td>
					<td>RunnersMatch was a web application built for my Introduction to Software Engineering Course, CSE115a to practice developing a project while using the Scrum process.  For the purpose of the course I was the Scrum Master and product owner of this project. Being a runner, I knew the struggle of attempting to train by myself and from this struggle RunnersMatch was born. RunnersMatch was designed to be a platform for runners to sign up and find other Runners in their local area to train with.  This project was built using <span class="importantWord">Scrum</span>, <span class="importantWord">React</span>, <span class="importantWord">JavaScript</span>, and <span class="importantWord">Firebase</span>.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="img/bearGif.gif" alt="Bear Gif" class="tablePhotos"></td>
					<td>This gif was made for my Digital Tools for Contemporary Art Practice, ART 80T, class at UCSC.  There's unfortunately no code for this, but it is a gif I made using <span class="importantWord">Adobe Photoshop</span> and <span class="importantWord">Adobe Illustrator</span>.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><img src="img/smartCalendar.png" alt="smartCalendar" class="stocksProjPhoto"></td>
					<td>Here is the SmartCalendar android application that I built for my Mobile Applications Course, CMPS121, at UCSC.  The purpose of the application was to create a "smart calendar" that would allow users to input tasks they have on any given day and the application would help the user better manage their time by giving reccomendations of how long a person should work each day to complete a certain task.  If the user did not complete the suggested time, the application would adjust the following days' required time neccessary to complete the application.  This application was built using <span class="importantWord">Java</span>, and <span class="importantWord">Android Studio</span>.</td>
